# Science in Motion — Website Package v5 Light

This package contains the updated bilingual website for **Science in Motion**.

## New in v5 Light
- Fixed the broken **Movement Analysis** image with the newly uploaded image.
- Upgraded the **Blog & Insights** section so it is easier to manage.
- Added **3 extra blog cover images**.
- The blog is now driven by a `blogPosts` array in `script.js`.
- Supports image posts and can also support **YouTube / Vimeo embeds** by adding an `embed` URL.
- Added a more premium visual treatment to the blog section.

## How to update blog content
Open `script.js` and find: `const blogPosts = [...]`

Each item has:
- `type`
- `image`
- `link`
- `embed`
- `el.title`, `el.text`
- `en.title`, `en.text`

### To add a video embed
Replace:
```js
embed: ""
```
with a valid embed URL, for example a YouTube embed link.

## What to upload to GitHub
Upload the **contents** of `scienceinmotion_site_v5_light/` to the root of your repository:
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `script.js`
- `README.md`
- `assets/`

## GitHub Pages
Then enable:
`Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → main → /root`


## Lightweight GitHub upload version

This version uses optimized `.webp` images so GitHub can accept the upload more easily.

Do **not** upload the `.zip` file to the repository. Extract it and upload only the folder contents:
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `script.js`
- `README.md`
- `assets/`


## Blog pages

The blog section now opens separate pages from the `posts/` folder.

Current posts:
- `posts/why-training-should-be-personalized.html`
- `posts/sedentary-work-and-exercise.html`
- `posts/qualified-personal-trainer-university-knowledge.html`

GitHub Pages supports multiple HTML pages. Links from the blog cards open these pages normally.

- Removed the blog intro paragraph so visitors only see the blog title and article cards.

## v8 services final update
